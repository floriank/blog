Blog
====

The GitHub pages repo I use for my blog. 

I am using [hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo) to generate the static content here. Check it out.

These are the raw files I use for the individual articles. They include drafts which might or might not get published at some point.

For the rendered contents, please either see https://floriank.github.io or the associated repository, https://github.com/floriank/floriank.github.io.
