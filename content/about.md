I am a software developer. That's mostly it. I am not very good at it, but somehow I found my way into several companies and dealt with some larger projects, so I think I might have some experience.

I am also practising Judo, although I guess I am not very good at that either. This blog does not contain anything about Judo. Probably.

Usually one would write here that they're passionate about some language or technology, but that is not the case for me. At least that's what I make myself believe from time to time. I will try making a point about not being super passionate about _new currently hyped technology X_ that just came out yesterday and is already the __future of the web__(tm) or __the next revolution__(tm).

I can provide some insights into the field though - and I hope that someone, especially new developers just starting out (looking at you, inexperienced college graduates) might find these insights useful.

Because after all, developing software is a joy to me and I like doing it for a living.
