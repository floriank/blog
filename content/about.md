I am a software developer. That's mostly it. I am not very good at it, but somehow I found my way into several companies and dealt with some larger projects, so I think I might have some experience. I currently work as a software developer / software architect at [kloeckner.i](https://kloeckner-i.com) and have built a team of about 25 developers there. We're tackling the challenge of transforming a whole industry and preparing it for a new digital age there - and I couldn't be happier to work with an awesome team of such gifted individuals.

I am also practising Judo, although I guess I am not very good at that either. This blog does not contain anything about Judo.

Usually one would write here that they're passionate about some language or technology, but that is not the case for me. At least that's what I make myself believe from time to time. I will try making a point about not being super passionate about _new currently hyped technology X_ that just came out yesterday and is already the __future of the web__(tm) or __the next revolution__(tm).

I can provide some insights into the field though - and I hope that someone, especially new developers just starting out might find these insights useful.

Because after all, developing software is a joy to me and I like doing it for a living.
