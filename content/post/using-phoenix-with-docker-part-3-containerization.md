_This is the final part of a three part series_: [Part 1]({{< ref "using-phoenix-with-docker-part-1-introduction.md" >}}) - [Part 2]({{< ref "using-phoenix-with-docker-part-2-implementation.md" >}}) - **Part 3**

## Conclusion

You have reached the end of this series. You might be interested in [how everything started]({{< ref "using-phoenix-with-docker-part-1-introduction.md" >}}) and how it [turned out to be implemented after all]({{< ref "using-phoenix-with-docker-part-2-implementation.md" >}}).

If you're interested what my thoughts are on _actual_ deployment and the performance of it all, check out the [addendum to this series](#addendum).
