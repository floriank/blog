_This is part two of a three part series_: [Part 1]({{< ref "using-phoenix-with-docker-part-1-introduction.md" >}}) - **Part 2** - [Part 3]({{< ref "using-phoenix-with-docker-part-3-containerization.md">}})

## Installation

Before we start, please make sure you install Elixir and Phoenix. If you do not care or have already installed both, you can skipt this part.

### Elixir

Installing Elixir is hopefully straight forward to you - it's **not** as convenient as just typing

```
sudo apt-get install elixir
```

as it equires the installation of Erlang and the **O**pen **T**elephony **P**latform (OTP). A more detailed guide on how to do the installation of Elixir (including the installation of Erlang/OTP [can be found on the homepage](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) - regardless of your preferred OS-choice. 

### Phoenix

## Conclusion

[In the next part]({{< ref "using-phoenix-with-docker-part-3-containerization.md" >}}), we'll look into finally using `docker` to gain containers for our project and use `docker compose` to orchestrate our system.

If you already forgot what this was all about, [check out part 1 to get a re-introduction]({{< ref "using-phoenix-with-docker-part-1-introduction.md">}}).
