_This is part two of a three part series_: [Part 1]({{< ref "using-phoenix-with-docker-part-1-introduction.md" >}}) - **Part 2** - [Part 3]({{< ref "using-phoenix-with-docker-part-3-containerization.md">}})

## Conclusion

[In the next part]({{< ref "using-phoenix-with-docker-part-3-containerization.md" >}}), we'll look into finally using `docker` to gain containers for our project and use `docker compose` to orchestrate our system.

If you already forgot what this was all about, [check out part 1 to get a re-introduction]({{< ref "using-phoenix-with-docker-part-1-introduction.md">}}).
